JSASTEM - JavaScript Arabic Stemmer

This little project aims to create a simple arabic stemmer 
implemented in JavaScript.

Why?

Good question. Because I need one for my other project,
Mabhathu Tulab (A student's place of research) which
is an Arabic - Arabic dictionary, similar to http://baheth.info
but better of course ;) Its main feature is that the
user may click on any word of a dictionary entry that may then
be further explained by an overlay.

How?

It seems no-one has implemented one in JavaScript yet, for
good reason I imagine. The ISRI stemmer as implemented by the
NLTK project seems like a very straight forward stemmer, nothing
too complicated and time consuming for my needs. This project
therefore aims to port the python script into javascript.
